# Lara's FitNotes (Android) Backup

I used FitNotes for Android for over a decade. Then I broke my phone, and
started using my sister's old iPhone. I found out that FitNotes isn't supported
on iOS. Absolutely heartbreaking. ðŸ˜”

I was able to export the data from my FitNotes app into a CSV. Using that, I
constructed a relational database schema. I set up a free project in Supabase to
store the data and then quickly built this app to display everything.

Eventually, it would be cool to be able to track workouts here, too.
